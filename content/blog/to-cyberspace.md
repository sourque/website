## Introduction

In terms of things that humans know and can do and things that we can't, most are in the latter.

To me, the most omnipresent reminder of this fact is the sky above us, that we can only barely begin to observe, quantify, or manipulate even with our best equipment.

Personally, the idea of contributing to humanity's progress on some front is extremely appealing. It's like playing a video game-- the desire to make progress is what supplies the motivation to continue playing. If I finally finish my epic three-story mountain house in Minecraft, I suddenly don't want to play it anymore, since the joy was in the progression rather than in acheiving the goal. And there are a lot of mountain houses to build in the real world.

But I've run into a problem here. Academia, biology, chemistry, and higher math, with their research papers, systemic reviews and meta-analyses... all of these can be fun and neat in moderation, but honestly, I can't see myself being happy day to day working in conventional fields that 'make a difference' and progress humanity's knowledge. I'm just a stinky cyber gremlin! I like messing with computers.[^x]

[^x]: Sure, there are some other options. I could do tech work for a hospital, try to support some effective altruism research group, or get involved with the development and progression of AI (or any number of things from [80,000 hours](https://80000hours.org/key-ideas/). I also think astrophysics is really neat. For some of those, I don't think I have the aptitude, and for others they just don't seem... enthralling. Since you only have one life, it makes sense to me to pursue what you think is the most cool.

Can you have your cake and eat it too? Not really! However, in my naïveté, I think the next best answer is to work in cyber security for some space place, and develop/analyze code to support satellites or other mission-critical functions. Or at least, that's what I think right now. The next best after that is probably going to be working for a cyber organization that does something you believe in, probably related to helping the public.

Alas, drats! I've run into another issue. I'm entirely incompetent and unqualified! But, as Einstein once said:

> Who are you? Get out of my house! No, I will not give a quote. Please don't come back.

Wait, what? That doesn't seem relevant. Is anyone fact checking these?

In any case, my ineptitude is a theoretically solveable challenge. In my mind, there are three main categories of skills that I'm lacking. These are:

1. Cell, radio, mobile, signals and signal processing
2. Low-level reversing and exploitation, vulnerability analysis
3. Classic space stuff: fundamentals of astrophysics, astronomy, and processing related data

Alright, easy enough. What follows in the rest of this internet page are resources, notes, and reviews pertaining to the above topics.
