Go program to automatically `ssh` into a specified range of boxes with specified (sets of) creds. This is supposed to be a useful alternative to Metasploit RCs or Ansible, in the context of red teaming for competitions.

You can run any scripts with it, and use the "preprocessor" options to control the program execution in ways that would otherwise be cumbersome (ex., run only one of the next three blocks).

You can find it at https://github.com/sourque/coordinate.
