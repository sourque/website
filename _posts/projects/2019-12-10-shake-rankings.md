The most consistent and dominating culinary presence in my life has, without a doubt, been the omnipotent chocolate shake. It has a place at an incredible number of restaurants, despite its seemingly niche purpose as a burger companion-- this might be because so many places serve burgers. Anyhow, here are my personal subjective rankings of every chocolate shake I've tried:

1  <span style="font-size: 1.5em;"><b>Five Guys</b></span>

The best shake I've had is from Five Guys because of its incredibly good flavor and consistency. They also allow you to mix flavors, which I would think (due to the greater combination of possibilities) would reduce quality, but I've found chocolate and banana is a great combo. Although, as anyone who has visited Five Guy's knows, it's very expensive.

Price: 3/10<br/>
Flavor: 10/10<br/>
Consistency: 10/10<br/>
Food-companionship: 9/10<br/>
Reproducibility: 7/10<br/>

2 <span style="font-size: 1.5em;"><b>In-N-Out</b></span>

In-N-Out is second on the list due to its consistency (in both senses of the word) and smooth flavor. It just tastes really good. I'm not a food critic or a shill, but In-N-Out shakes go well with their fries and burger, while being pretty cheap. You can easily get two full meals (with large shakes) for under twenty dollars.

Price: 8/10<br/>
Flavor: 9/10<br/>
Consistency: 8/10<br/>
Food-companionship: 9/10<br/>
Reproducibility: 7/10<br/>

3 <span style="font-size: 1.5em;"><b>Classic Malt Shop</b></span>

Classic Malt Shop is a small chain that had a pretty darn good shake. It wasn't mind-blowing and it didn't change my life, but I couldn't really find anything bad with it. Just an all around good shake.

Price: 7/10<br/>
Flavor: 9/10<br/>
Consistency: 8/10<br/>
Food-companionship: 8/10<br/>
Reproducibility: 9/10<br/>


4 <span style="font-size: 1.5em;"><b>Jack in the Box</b></span>

Jack in the Box delivers a quality shake that goes well with their food (tacos especially). Very solid consistency and taste, and it almost always tastes exactly the same. For Jack in the Box though, where you can get 10 tacos for around $6, a $4 or $5 shake is a bit too expensive.

Price: 5/10<br/>
Flavor: 8/10<br/>
Consistency: 8/10<br/>
Food-companionship: 8/10<br/>
Reproducibility: 10/10<br/>

5 <span style="font-size: 1.5em;"><b>Chick-fil-A</b></span>

I stand by my statement that Chick-fil-A is just slightly fancier McDonalds. Their chicken sandwich is pretty good and goes with the shake pretty well. It loses by a hair to Jack in the Box in flavor and food compatibility, although it's less expensive.

Price: 7/10<br/>
Flavor: 7/10<br/>
Consistency: 8/10<br/>
Food-companionship: 7/10<br/>
Reproducibility: 9/10<br/>

6 <span style="font-size: 1.5em;"><b>Wendy's</b></span>

Wendy's shake or frosty or whatever is the bottom of the barrel for the mid-tier shakes. It's alright, but I wouldn't often spend my own money on it. Doesn't go too well with most things on the menu, a bit too expensive for the product, and mediocre consistency.

Price: 5/10<br/>
Flavor: 7/10<br/>
Consistency: 5/10<br/>
Food-companionship: 6/10<br/>
Reproducibility: 8/10<br/>

7 <span style="font-size: 1.5em;"><b>Swensons</b></span>

This is a small restaurant chain, but the shake I had there was pretty bad. I opted for the banana and chocolate (naively hoping for a replication of Five Guy's), but it turns out that, at least for Swensons, mixing flavors results in something extremely artificial-tasting and off-putting. It had a solid consistency and I believe the plain chocolate would've been much better. Can't score reproducibility since I've only had one. Decent price. 

Price: 6/10<br/>
Flavor: 1/10<br/>
Consistency: 7/10<br/>
Food-companionship: 7/10<br/>
Reproducibility: X/10<br/>

8 <span style="font-size: 1.5em;"><b>Shake Shack</b></span>

For a place with "shake" in the name, Shake Shack's chocolate shake was terrible. I can't score its reproducibility because I'd never get it again, but it tastes like someone blended ice and squirted in some Hershey's chocolate syrup. It's also very expensive! Like, why? I think the Oreo shake is much better-- it'd have to be for them to still be in business. 

Price: 3/10<br/>
Flavor: 2/10<br/>
Consistency: 1/10<br/>
Food-companionship: 4/10<br/>
Reproducibility: X/10<br/>
