SoCal Cyber Cup (SCCC) is a local competition for Southern Californi. It was a jeopardy-style CTF paired with virtual machines hosted on AWS via the "Haiku Cyber Range." So, a bunch of forensic questions or hints on where to find a flag.

There were a lot of interesting challenges, like using a flag from one challenge to decrypt a physical USB, and use another flag to decrypt a 7zip archive, which then boots a virtual damn small linux image, which the flag is in the root directory of. Or a bunch of stuff with web servers, locked down web kiosks (forcing web browsing via wget and powershell) and sifting through wireshark captures. It was a good balance of difficulty and interesting variety for high school students. I also got to meet and talk to some opposing teams, and made some friends.

My team ended up winning, which was pretty neat. One of the other competitors asked me how I prepared, which I really didn't have a good answer to. The best answer I've come up with, with my limited knowledge, is to just do as many other CTFs as possible, compete in other events, read related books, practice as many practical skills as possible (not relying on the theoretical), and to always strive to learn more. Of course, what I ended up telling him was "compete in everything you can," but whatever.
