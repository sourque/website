Choosing high school classes can be tough. There are many classes and relatively few due to the bastardization of the semester system, and the choices you make affect you a lot more due to the incredibly restrictive schedule and attendance policy of most high schools.

So, in my circumstances, I wanted to take AP Computer Science for a few reasons:

1. To skip introductory computer science in college
2. To prove to myself that I can study for it by myself and enjoy it
3. To learn more about computer science

So, __how did I self study for this__? I got a 5 on my exam-- which isn't meant to brag, but rather suggest that my plan of study was effective. I used four resources and methods:

1. **Barron's AP Computer Science Book.** Hands down the best 'textbook' for this course, covers all the material concisely and well, with a bunch of practice problems and examples.
2. **YouTube videos.** There's a lot of high quality content put up on YouTube by APCS teachers, especially the yearlong reviews ("_AP Computer Science in X minutes_"). These serve as a good overview before studying, and a review before the test.
3. **My school's APCS finals.** Asking my school's AP Computer Science teacher if I could take his final was a great way to force myself to study, and a good place to practice and receive feedback.
4. **Codingbat**. Codingbat was a really good tool (especially the AP problem set) for getting practice actually writing Java code. Practice, practice, practice.

Those are the resources I used, but in what order, and how long did it take me?

> Note: I did not spend much time studying for this test. I had some previous knowledge about bash scripting and procedural programming languages, as well as general knowledge about number systems and other basic CS concepts. If you do not have this base, you should probably take the class if you can.

Here's a summary of what I did, in order. I started studying 17 April 2019, a month before the test.

1. **Watch an APCS yearlong review video on YouTube.** This will give you an idea of the scope of the course, and you can do it while eating something. I did this during the week, took about an hour.

2. **Read the Barron's AP Computer Science Book**. Just straight up, front to back. The chapters are super short, the majority of the book is practice questions. Take notes if it helps you-- I have my notes hosted on this website. I did not do the practice questions when I read it. This took me two Saturdays.

3. __Do Codingbat problems__. In order to help you actually write code, make sure you are practiced with manipulating strings, boolean values, arrays, etc. Codingbat problems do NOT cover two dimensional arrays, or writing method headers-- these two are things you should search online for practice with, or just use a text editor and a Java compiler. I did this after I finished the Barron's book for about three days.

4. __Take practice tests and do practice problems__. If you can take the APCS final with the kids in the class, do that. If not, take at least one Barron's practice test, or a test from somewhere else. I did this after doing Codingbat problems, and the final was spread out over three days. I also did Barron's chapter problems for more specific questions in the week before the exam.

5. __Review your practice test and notes (if taken)__. About three days before the exam, you should know all the course material and be well practiced. I took the three days before the exam to review my notes, and the day of the exam, reviewed my practice test (do this earlier if possible). Also, watch another YouTube yearlong review.

   > Note: be aware of changes to the course (especially for 2019 - 2020) and make sure your study materials are up to date. Know that you will have the Java quick reference during the test, and be familiar with the published AP Java subset.

Okay, cool, __how did I motivate myself__? I was interested in the topic, and knew a lot of general information beforehand. The most difficult topic for me to learn was Object Orientated Programming principles (inheritance, polymorphism, etc) since I had only used procedural languages before. I also had to learn the specifics of Java syntax, data types, seemingly trivial rules, and whatnot. But anyway, my main methods of motivation or maintaining consistency were:

1. Sign up for the test way ahead of time.
2. Plan your studying time and resources to use beforehand.
3. Ask the APCS teacher to meet with you, or take a final, or something to hold yourself accountable.
4. Have friends that take the class and exam to discuss problems with.
5. Have reasons for wanting to take the test other than just doing well on an AP test.

Good luck if you choose to self study AP Computer Science!
