TL;DR: Studying for the CCENT was fun, and picking up on what works for me has helped me accomplish my goals more effectively.  I have always been absolutely terrible at studying.

I love the concept of knowing a lot. Picking up a hefty textbook on physics or math and flipping through it makes me wish I sat down and understood everything in the book. There's so much knowledge contained within these pages. I don't know what drives this compulsory infatuation with books and the idea of learning, but, as is paralleled in my studies, concepts are a far cry from practicality and actually _doing_ things.

I write this here to internalize and make sense of my experience with self-studying the CCENT. Obviously, if you're here, it's your choice, so I really don't mind rambling. I feel like once ideas are put into words, they become concrete, since they must conform to the customs and methodologies of the English language, and all the sentences and ideas you've consumed before. Kind of like a forced modularity at some level.

Studying for the CCENT has been the first time that I feel like I've actually applied myself. Truly put all of my time and effort into something, at least for the week before the exam where I consumed 7+ hours of CBT Nuggets, Wendel Odom's wisdom, and Boson ExSim practice tests per day. 

How was I able to do this? I had resigned myself to "I'm not able to study," but in reality, I didn't think it was necessary. I've got pretty good at putting in the minimum amount of effort in schoolwork to get a good grade. In terms of infosec, I mostly learned from doing projects and searching questions I have on a whim, with no grand study plan. This worked to accumulate small bits of knowledge and some bash proficiency, but no deep knowledge of a certain field. Doing CTFs are also fun and helped develop my practical skill, but really, have their limits for actually being a learning tool-- they encourage cursory research and basic practical skills. 

I think I was able to study so intensely for a few reasons:

1. There was a deadline and a test: studying was a priority.

   Setting the test date ahead of time helped me solidify a time line to study and summarize all my knowledge, and let me plan out when to take practice tests, how many videos to watch per day, how many pages to review, and made other logistical challenges easier. Without this, I would've felt like learning too much to early would lead me to forget things later (a flawed assumption, but present nonetheless) or be able to postpone my studying because it wouldn't feel like a priority.

2. I had someone to study and compete with.

   Having a 'study buddy' is often recommended, but I never found the truth in it, probably because the other criteria on this list were not met, or the buddy was not motivated or disciplined to study as well. But, this time, I had a dedicated friend to help study with me, plan test dates with, and ask questions to. This supplemented my own motivation to study and made it a lot more difficult to postpone the test date. Having a community focused on a test or subject, such as /r/ccna, also helped with accountability and lending me confidence.

3. The subject material and study resources were very interesting, and at my level.

   This is, I feel, a large reason why I've never been able to do this before. Self-studying for the SAT, chemistry, or calculus just doesn't have the same spark for me as studying networking or other infosec topics. Even then, when the subject material was exceedingly interesting (my first attempt at Practical Malware Analysis, for example), my study efforts failed in some of the other criteria, or it was above my level at the time. The CCENT exam was precisely at my level when I started studying, and was incredible interesting: Jeremy Cioara was very entertaining and helpful in his ICND1 CBT Nugget videos, and even in the bit drier Odom book, learning all the details of _how_ the magic of networking worked kept me invested and interested.

4. I had pre-planned resources.

   Just throwing myself into a certain topic without researching and obtaining resources fails almost every time for me. Mainly, this is because there's no route to start. When I think, "I want to study for X," it's incredibly helpful to reduce effort and have confidence in your materials by making the next thought, "I can watch X videos or read X high quality book" rather than "I wonder how to start" or "I think this resource is good that I just found."

5. It was summer, and I had free time.

   It helped that I had a lot of free time, because it was the last week of summer, and I wasn't tired from the day's activities. I don't think this is incredibly necessary, but it made it much more practical and easy to spend 7 hours a day studying. 

6. My room was clean.

   This sounds very weird written down, but, in the time before I really started studying for my test, my room was rather cluttered with things that I didn't enjoy, and I feel, drew me back into other topics rather than letting my focus on what I want to study. I think having a clean, minimal room helps, for me, with every task requiring focus or discipline.
   
7. I was on an eating schedule.

    Again, another strange point-- however, I believe that whenever an _essential_ (whatever they view as essential) task is given to a human, they tend to expand the time taken to complete it to occupy the whole allotment of time they have. This is usually accompanied by making excuses that they couldn't complete anything the "wanted" to do, while only having "time" to do the necessary, while in reality spending an incredible amount of time screwing around, be it by eating, watching television or YouTube, or whatever leisure they prefer. This is why only eating one meal a day, or twice a day in between a specific time period, allowed me to focus more on what I wanted to do, while preventing me from filling up my day with food and garbage. 

Whatever perfect storm of factors led to my successful studying, I think the most important thing that I got out of this experience (besides the certification) was confidence in myself that I could actually study, and I knew how. Before, I thought I was just incredibly terrible at studying, be it an interesting topic or not. But with a healthy helping of self reflection, I realized, plain and clear, that's not the case.
