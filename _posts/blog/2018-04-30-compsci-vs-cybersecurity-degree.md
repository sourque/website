The public opinion appears rather unanimous surrounding this topic, with most speaking to the tune of:

> "Stick with a major in Comp Sci (CS for short, just to avoid confusion). You'll be able to do anything you want with  that, and not pigeonhole yourself into just one field of CS." [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/2avsj6/degree_in_cyber_security/cizho6p)

> "And what about the idea that the graduates of cybersecurity programs should be drawn from students who   somehow are better at thinking outside of the box? Quite simply, it is a notion that is grossly ignorant of what has actually been working for decades. Until recently, the NSA had never hired anyone with a cybersecurity degree. And yet the NSA is widely considered to be the world's leader in information security and information warfare. How then did the NSA establish such pre-eminence in the field?"

As I am in favor of the idea of a cyber security/cyber operations/infosec degree, I would like to offer a rebuttal of these arguments.


1. Cyber security degrees are low quality money grabs.

   This point has some merit to it, especially a few years ago (when most of the online discussions took place). The wild west of low quality programs, uninformed professors, a bad curriculum, and no practical experience was a reality, and it still is to a certain _degree_ (haha). That is why, as with other programs, it's very important to do research on the college of interest, survey past students, and check their awards or certifications.

   The NSA has helped greatly with that last point, with their [CAE-CD, CAE-R](https://www.nsa.gov/resources/educators/centers-academic-excellence/cyber-defense/), and [CAE-CO](https://www.nsa.gov/resources/educators/centers-academic-excellence/cyber-operations/) designations for schools of excellence in Cyber Defense, Research, and Cyber Operations respectively. These help ensure better programs through some requirements set forth by the NSA. While it is true that "[u]ntil recently, the NSA had never hired anyone with a cybersecurity degree," that was only because it's an emerging specialization and there were no standards in place.

   Even moreso, the [CyberCorps Scholarship for Service](https://www.sfs.opm.gov/) program offers scholarships at certain quailfied schools. Schools who offer this scholarship and have the NSA's previously mentioned designations represent an even better program, according to the NSA, who is most certainly a qualified body of judgment.

2. Cyber security is overspecializing, too early.

   I once read an argument that read something like "you can't just get a cyber security degree because it would be fun. Podiatrists don't get to skip med school just to play with feet." Ignoring the bitter undertones of that argument, I would say that if medical school offered an alternative where the person would focus on knowledge about feet, so they could get more pertinent experience-- but even this isn't an accurate representation. The field of cyber security is much more like the field of science in the 1800s: one intelligent person could be a "scientist," knowledgeable of the fields of chemistry, physics, and biology. In modern times, that is absolutely infeasible, given the vast amount of information in a certain field. Biology degrees still have a strong grounding in the fundamentals of science (scientific method, experimentation, reasoning), but are specialized for good reason. This is much like a good cyber security degree, especially with the correct choice of electives (not striving away from math, cryptography, electronics, etc), which is founded in technical, fundamental computer science concepts while offering multifarious benefits for those interested in security.

   Cyber security degrees are now similar to this. Without a concentration, masters, or some focus on security, computer science majors alone need a lot of training or outside (self taught or otherwise) training if they want to be a cyber security professional. While it may offer a wider variety of jobs and opportunities, for someone who's sure they want to do _something_ in the massive security field, just like a biologist who is sure they won't swap to physics or chemistry, a degree focusing in security is the best bet.

3. Cyber security degrees aren't job-applicable.

   As previously mentioned, the NSA, arguably the largest and best body of cyber security experts in the world, has personally handed out designations and frequently hires people from CAE-CD/CAE-CO/CAE-R schools or recipients of the CyberCorps program ([description here](https://dsu.edu/academics/academic-opportunities/cyber-corps)). The NSA, representing an extremely high standard of technical competence, easily demonstrates that cyber security degrees are very applicable to the real world.

4. Other reasons


   Personally, I am not _extremely_ enthusiastic about raw, unapplied math, and would prefer to not _only_ take entirely theoretical courses which can be subjectively dry at times. Let's take a look at the matriculation or plans of study for two reputable colleges:


   [University of Omaha, Nebraska](https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-information-science-and-technology/school-of-interdisciplinary-informatics/_files/docs/bscy/Matriculation%20Form.pdf)'s cyber security degree.

   And [University of California Santa Barbara](https://my.sa.ucsb.edu/catalog/Current/Documents/2017_Majors/ENGR/CS%2017-18.pdf)'s compsci program.
       
   <img class="image" src="https://543hn.com/assets/images/ucsbmatriculation.png" alt="University of Omaha, Nebraska'">
       
   UCSB primarily has one computer science course per trimester, and some math, physics, or general education reqruiement with a bit more freedom and computer science as the years progress. This is not, to me, an extremely interesting or focused matriculation. Similar ones can be seen in most affordable computer science programs. Compared to UNO, which boasts a lot of sysadmin, vulnerability research, and fundamental computer science subjects, UCSB's curriculum seems, at a cursory glance and with a specialized expectation for cyber security content, weak.

   In terms of self-distinction as well, as I ask some of my friends (n=15) which majors they intend to go into, attempting to ask a fair sampling and not just computer-interested friends, 11 of them state "computer science." In our computer-centric world, it is just a ubiquitous field, much like the job of "scientist" evolved to be centuries ago.

   As a final point, people in these degree programs, assuming they also did their research and chose a reputable program, are very like-minded, and these degrees present an amazing opportunity to meet both relevant peers and professors (compared to a computer science degree, which is __very__ popular) interested in the same things are you, and more likely to be able to offer pertinent and interesting opportunities or information.

   It is worth noting that some computer science degree programs have excellent concentrations in cyber security (such as UTSA), and offer a good compromise if one is on the fence about a cyber security degree. However, these programs still sometimes lack in the security community aspect, extracurriculars/clubs, professor interaction opportunities, or a campus-wide focus on security.

Even moreso as I contemplate and research colleges and degree programs, I'm struck with the conclusion that nearly every college can offer a good experience, and it's more important to find a college that won't leave you with tons of debt, has a program that interests you, and has competitions or programs that can involve you. Nonetheless, it is for all these reasons that I am choosing to pursue a cyber security / cyber operations degree, and I hope the public opinion of these degrees improves to match their modern quality.
