TL;DR, Video games are good sometimes but usually not worth it as a hobby.

I've been playing since I was around 6-7 years old, starting my pseudo-addiction and long term infatuation with video games by spending hours on Webkinz or with "[Funkeys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.B._Funkeys)." Recently, in the past few years (2012-2018), I have begun to specialize in almost only first person shooters. I find aim to be one of the most integral, satisfying, and cathartic parts of playing games (on PC). I like to pick one game and nearly exclusively play it for years at a time. Most recently, this game has been Overwatch.

Before this, I was enthralled in Valve's [Team Fortress 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress_2), amassing over 2,000 hours in about five years. I'm not terribly good at these games. In competitive TF2, I peaked on a Gold (in [UGC](https://ugcleague.com)'s ranking system) 6s (six players) team as a scout. In Overwatch I've peaked at 4021 SR as of this writing.

I wrote a persuasive essay in seventh grade-- after I had been on a competitive TF2 team for a while-- that argued the benefits and negative aspects of playing video games. Obviously, I had argued the positive aspects. I found some articles referring to studies that found that hand-eye coordination, reaction times, and fine motor skills had been improved by playing video games, or that video games helped people overcome their fear of spiders, heights, or clowns through immersive gameplay, or that lazy eye could be reduced by playing video games. 

I find all these reasons weak. People who had no fear of spiders, lazy eye, or any desire to improve their fine motor skills would find no reason video games would be good for _them_. I completed the purpose of the paper, which was to argue why video games were good, but I argued why they were good for our society and other people with fixable problems. That's not what the common person was interested in, what the people who look down upon people who play video games with disdain while watching dramas for the majority of the day. Those people don't see the interest to _them_. 

I honestly did not know why I enjoyed video games. I just knew that I liked to get home, launch TF2, and play it until I was tired. My life does not require much self-discipline or motivation, so often I just do what I feel like, which led to no self-reflection or attempt to find the reasoning behind _why_ I liked to play TF2. I still don't entirely know what the addictive appeal of it is. That's all fine and good for a 5th grader, but with enough time comes the consequences of playing Skyrim or TF2 for 5 hours a day. But, strangely, it also helps accentuate the positive and social aspects of playing, knowing that you can't spend all day playing-- I don't take them for granted anymore.

In Overwatch especially, there is a fantastic sense of community and presence when playing. An intuitive voice chat system and chats, groups, only a handful of people per team, and a pretty decent friends interface/forums.

This is the first reason why video games are "good": there is a __sense of community and social interaction__. Isolation and depravity of all social stimulation is a terrible thing regardless of the how introverted someone might be. How do you spend weeks during summer in high school (if not interning somewhere) without going out, and still not feel lonely? Video games, especially ones with real people and frequent social interactions. Competitive teams and tournaments enhance this effect even more, with a strong sense of camaraderie.

Another positive is __critical thinking__: its greatly encouraged by playing video games, or just games. Chess is a fantastic (if not distilled) version of this, where visualizing is incredibly important. If you're playing Overwatch, or League of Legends, or CS:GO, and you feel as though your visualization skills or critical thinking isn't being challenged or put to use, you could probably improve a lot. If an individual goes into a game with the intent to _think_, I feel like it's a surefire way to improve. 

My final point that I would have put in an honest, persuasive essay-- this last point may be specific to me, but in aim-based games, the mechanic of aiming itself is very relaxing (unless you're missing every shot), especially if you're playing with the right mindset. If you only have an hour to yourself and you need to "relax," playing a video game is a way to do that. Is it the best way? In some situations, but usually, no.

Video games are genuinely good in a lot of situations, but also truly bad, hence the common social stigma of the video game audience being lazy and nonproductive. Video games are a time _vacuum_ to me. I can throw hour after hour down into the massive well of Overwatch and consume an entire weekend doing nothing other than that, sleeping, eating, and watching videos (usually about Overwatch!), and I would feel productive because any real work I did was in between queuing for games, and multitasking is a great illusion of productivity.

Playing copious amounts of games makes you stand still in whatever pursuit you have. For example, for a while, I tried to self study for my CCENT. I would play Overwatch "before" reading, then find that I only had time to finish part of my homework and sleep for some hours, and repeat that cycle, feeling like I never got a chance when really my situation was entirely preventable and self-enforced. This is my main problem with video games that has arisen as I pursue things other than video games.

In the same vein of being able to manage your time, at least for me, there are _only_ three outcomes to a session of Overwatch.

1. You win, and you continue to play, and win some more, until the whole day is consumed.
2. You lose a lot and feel frustrated, which to me, destroys any discipline I had to do things that were actually fulfilling.
    - 2a. You keep playing, and keep losing, and hate yourself.
    - 2b. You try to quit, and don't have any motivation.
3. You play and win some, or lose some, and it doesn't matter because you're having a good time, but you still lose a lot of time and end up feeling satisfied with just playing, and lose motivation or discipline to accomplish anything that actually helps you.

The realization of this, cycle led me to stop playing Overwatch for about two years. I've recently (late 2019) started playing again for my college, but only in a competitive team setting-- which remedies much of these problems while augmenting the positive qualities of video games (such as socializing and critical thinking).

As DaFran (a famous Overwatch player) once said on stream, after talking about how he starting playing video games seriously before age 12, "I just kept playing and now I'm 22. I remember nothing." Video games aren't a replacement for reality.

Video games can be a tremendous force for good for the reasons listed above and whatever personal reasons someone may have, but up to a certain point. Depending on your personality, playtime, and environment when in a game, it may be best to either consciously lessen time spent on it, or part ways with it.
