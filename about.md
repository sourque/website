# Hello! I'm Shane.

<img style="width:115%;" src="/assets/images/about.jpg"/> <br/>

I enjoy understanding things. Be it through adamant inquisition, voracious reading, or just walking the fine line between hopelessly breaking things and not, this is what it boils down to for me. I want to be constantly learning and improving, and to be able to apply that knowledge.

I put written creations (primarily blog posts) and other creations (notes, projects, etc) on this website. I'm currently a student at Dakota State University.

<p style="font-size:0.8em;"> This website uses a heavily modified version of Kopplin's <a class="link" href="https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo">Indigo theme</a>.
